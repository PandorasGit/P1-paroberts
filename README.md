## Project Report: Iteration 3

### Reflection
- Scope has been a problem with the whole project. Each iteration I have desired to redo the assets and polish the theme of the game, but the time investment to get it mechanically working has taken up any time I would dedicate for assets. I was hoping for this iteration to spend the time here from what I assumed would be polishing animations to add my own assets. Sadly I spent much more time than what I was expecting cleaning the code and improving existiing systems. Randomizing the target layout cost a lot of time that I could have used to stylize the visuals, but I believe adding in randomization makes the game more unique each play sessions.

### Self-Assessment

- [X] D-1: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file in its top-level directory.
- [X] D-2: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
- [X] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file, no unnecessary files tracked, and all commit messages following <a href="https://cbea.ms/git-commit/">our style guide</a>.
- [X] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [X] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file, and you have satisfied all license requirements.
- [X] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game.
- [X] C-5: The game starts on a title screen. Interacting with the title screen moves the player into the gameplay screen.
- [X] B-1: The project report is complete.
- [X] B-2: Earn one star.
- [X] A-1: Generate neither warnings nor errors at runtime.
- [X] A-2: Earn three stars.
- [x] ⭐ When the game is over, the player can interact to take the game back to the title screen, from which the game can be played again.
- [X] ⭐ Use an <code>AnimationPlayer</code> or <code>Tween</code> to add some pop to the user-interface.
- [X] ⭐ The source code complies with [the GDScript guidlines](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guidelines/best-practices/godot-gdscript/).

Therefore this work merits an A.
