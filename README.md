## Project Report: Iteration 1

### Reflection
- One difficulty that came with this iterationn is how to cleanly code in a game design environment. The code just feels difficult to gauge how clean it is with the stipulations of the engine. Scope is also something the worries me. I've invested all this time thus far into this project and feels like Ive not done anything at all with it. It was however, very exciting to get the game to function to be self adjusting the control projectile. I believe that seperates this project enough from the expect design to be proud of it.
