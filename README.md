# Project Reports
- The project report is a required section of the ReadMe file for grading in Dr G's CS 315 course. For ease of grading, they are orders from most to least recent. The markdown for the Self-Assesment is pulled from [the course plan](https://www.cs.bsu.edu/~pvgestwicki/courses/cs315Fa22/projects#instructions).

## Project Report: Iteration 2

### Reflection
- 

### Self-Assessment

- [X] D-1: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file in its top-level directory.
- [X] D-2: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
- [ ] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file, no unnecessary files tracked, and all commit messages following <a href="https://cbea.ms/git-commit/">our style guide</a>.
- [ ] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [X] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file, and you have satisfied all license requirements.
- [X] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game.
- [X] C-5: The projectile and targets are shown with 2D graphics.
- [X] C-6: The game plays an appropriate sound effect when the projectile is fired, and the sound effect is correctly stored as a <code>.wav</code> asset.
- [ ] B-1: The project report is complete.
- [X] B-2: Earn one star.
- [ ] A-1: Earn three stars.
- [X] ⭐ The player has a small inventory of projectiles, and only one can be launched at a time.
- [X] ⭐ The background and ground use 2D graphics.
- [] ⭐ A <abbr title="Heads-Up Display">HUD</abbr> shows the current game state such as the score and number of projectiles remaining.


This work therefore merits A.

## Project Report: Iteration 1

### Reflection
- One difficulty that came with this iterationn is how to cleanly code in a game design environment. The code just feels difficult to gauge how clean it is with the stipulations of the engine. Scope is also something the worries me. I've invested all this time thus far into this project and feels like Ive not done anything at all with it. It was however, very exciting to get the game to function to be self adjusting the control projectile. I believe that seperates this project enough from the expect design to be proud of it.

- [X] C-5: The player can fire the projectile.
- [X] C-6: The player can control the angle at which the projectile is fired.
- [X] C-7: The projectile's flight is affected by gravity using Godot Engine's physics system.
- [X] C-8: There is a “ground” that stops the projectile
- [X] B-1: The project report is complete.
- [X] B-2: The projectile's firing angle is clamped between 0° (straight forward) and 90° (straight up).
- [X] B-3: There is a non-ground target that the projectile can hit.
- [X] A-1: The player can modify the strength of the projectile's firing.
- [X] A-2: There is a visual indicator showing the angle at which the projectile will fire.
- [X] A-3: The projectile's hitting the target is recognized and logged to the console or otherwise indicated.

This work therefore merits A.
